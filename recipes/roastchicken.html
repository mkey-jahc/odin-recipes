        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Noone likes a <strong>dry</strong> chicken. Yet, we plague our families and our bellies with it time and time again.</p>  <p><em>Look no further.</em> We're here to turn it all around for you. All you need is passion, commitment and a little patience; by the time you know it you'll be feasting on a juicy, scrumptious chicken.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
                <li> salt and black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
                <li>Â½ cup margarine, divided</li>
                <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>      
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season generously inside and out with salt and pepper. 
        Sprinkle inside and out with onion powder. 
        Place 3 tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity. 
        Arrange dollops of the remaining margarine around the chicken's exterior. 
        Cut the celery into 3 or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity.</li>
                <li>Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. 
        An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). 
        Remove from heat and baste with melted margarine and drippings.
        Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rest about 30 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
